## üìñ About Sufra

**Sufra** addresses two critical global challenges:
1. **Food Waste**: Hotels, weddings, and celebrations generate large quantities of edible food that are discarded daily
2. **Food Insecurity**: Low-income citizens and daily wage workers struggle to afford regular meals

By leveraging GENAI (LangChain, LangGraph) reasoning and geolocation, Sufra creates a transparent, real-time link between food surplus and those who need it most.

### üéØ Our Mission
Promote zero food waste, ensure access to affordable meals, and support the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
